Hello,

This is a servo project in which I helped with the code, but it was my first attempt at coding with HTML. 
A Particle Photon was used to detect motion and notify the user via email, allowing them to adjust the crossbow
to shoot in a specific direction. Upon adjustment, it would also send an email to the user.
